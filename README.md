Welcome to Rainydays, an online jacket store. This project was initiated as part of a front-end development course in which I learned about Javascript and basic usage of it.

## Description

My Rainydays website is designed to be a simple and user-friendly jacket store, featuring a clean look and easy layout.
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the products are fetched dynamically using the WordPress API. 

Key features of the website include:

- displaying the trending products on the "home" page.
- short description of each jacket
- size selector
- A fully responsive design for mobile and desktop users
